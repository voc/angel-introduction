# c3voc Angel Introduction
This repo contains the slides to the A/V angel introduction sessions of the [c3voc](https://c3voc.de).

There are two training concepts now:

1. Old training with a full introduction for events without "experienced" A/V angels (e.g. FOSSGIS)
    - Introduction meeting should use [folien.pdf](folien.pdf)
1. New training with a brief update for experienced angels and hands-on training for newcomers (usual CCC events)
    - Take a look at the "selftraining" PDFs ([Basics](selftraining-basics.pdf), [Camera](selftraining-camera.pdf), [Video Mixer](selftraining-mixer.pdf) as well as a general talk timeline for [1 camera](selftraining-talk_timeline-1cam.pdf) or [2 cameras](selftraining-talk_timeline-2cam.pdf))
    - Introduction meeting should use [introduction.pdf](introduction.pdf)
